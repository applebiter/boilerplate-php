# Boilerplate-PHP

It's a CakePHP 4 skeleton application with a custom authentication and 
authorization scheme using a relational database backend. It is designed
to be interoperable with a boilerplate Qt (C++) desktop application, which
is another of my repos, applebiter/boilerplate-qt.

## Standards and Convention

CakePHP asks that developers adhere to convention. The more the developer
adheres to the CakePHP way of doing things, the more utility CakePHP can
deliver. Well, it's really only useful up to a point, anyway. What we want
is secure code that does all of the generic, boring stuff so that when we
code we may focus on the interesting, domain-specific programming that our
particular project needs. I think my authentication and authorization
solutions are more powerful and flexible than the native CakePHP solutions,
and it's naive to imagine that we won't need user management and file
management built in, as well.

## Evolving, Never Finished

At this time, it's really not finished at all, but it soon will be at a place
where the code is all useful and coherent. I don't write tests. Oh, everything
is tested, but I don't write tests to prove to others I have tested it. If
that's a problem, it's all good. You can either move along or write the tests.
It is open source, after all. At some arbitrary point I will consider it to be
a v1.0 release and probably only ever return to it if I absolutely have to.
